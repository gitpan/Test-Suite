NAME
    Test::Suite - A more modern testing framework for perl

DESCRIPTION
    Test-Suite is a test framework that addresses several complains I have
    heard, or have myself issued forth about perl testing. It is still based
    off Test::Builder and uses a lot of existing test tools.

    Please see Test::Suite::Specification for more details.

EARLY VERSION WARNING
    This is VERY early version. Test::Suite does not run yet.

    Please go to <http://github.com/exodist/Test-Suite> to see the latest
    and greatest.
